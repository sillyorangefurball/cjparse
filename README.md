# CJParse - A simple JSON parser written in C

A parser library for json. This is mostly an excercise for myself to practice coding. Feel free to make any suggestions. There currently does not exist a way to dump json, as I wrote this for another prject of mine, and that functionality is not required by it. Depending on my needs, I might add it in later or someone makes a pull request
